# carousel-interview

This is a work-in-progress side project for a fully functioning server-side and client-side carousel interview app, allowing interviewers to create stations being used in the interview, create a scoring criteria for each station, mark applicants and leave comments during the interview. The program will then analyze the scoring criteria and ouput a list of most-recommended to least-recommended applicants (by standardizing interviewer scores, analyzing data such as phrases/key words left in comments) for interviewers to view. Currently being built using Django, React, HTML, CSS, and Python.
